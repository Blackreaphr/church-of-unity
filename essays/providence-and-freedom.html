        <h2>Question</h2>
        <p>How can providence be affirmed without denying real human freedom and responsibility? The Church of Unity receives both truths and seeks a clear account that serves prayer, moral action, and hope.</p>

        <h2>Scripture</h2>
        <blockquote>
          A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.
          <br><cite>Prov. 16.9 (KJV)</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
          <br><cite>Phil. 2.13 (KJV)</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life.
          <br><cite>Deut. 30.19 (KJV)</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.
          <br><cite>Rom. 8.28 (KJV)</cite>

        <h2>Terms</h2>
        <p><strong>Providence:</strong> God's wise governance of creation. God gives being and order and directs all things toward the good.
        <br><strong>Freedom:</strong> The creature's real power to choose the good. Freedom matures as the will cleaves to what is truly good.
        <br><strong>Primary and secondary causes:</strong> God acts at a deeper order as first cause. Creatures act as true secondary causes within the world.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Two Classical Accounts</h2>
        <p><strong>1) Primary and secondary causality.</strong> God is present to each action as first cause. Creatures act as secondary causes. The more God gives, the more the creature becomes itself. On this view, grace does not compete with freedom. Grace perfects nature. This account appears in Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae I.22.</p>
        <p><strong>2) Compatibilist sovereignty.</strong> Many Reformed theologians hold that divine sovereignty and human responsibility can stand together when a choice flows from one's character and reasons. God orders the whole, and persons still act as moral agents. Trust in divine wisdom and the formative power of obedience are emphasized.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Other Proposals</h2>
        <p><strong>Libertarian freedom.</strong> Some hold that at least some human choices are not determined by prior states. Responsibility follows from genuine alternatives. This highlights accountability, yet can stumble when trying to say how God foreknows free acts.</p>
        <p><strong>Open models of foreknowledge.</strong> Others hold that God knows all that can be known and that future free acts are known as possibilities until they occur. This stresses relationship and risk, yet must explain strong claims of providence and prophecy.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>A Working Synthesis</h2>
        <p>Christians need not choose between providence and freedom. A careful synthesis can be stated in plain steps. God gives existence and the power to act. That gift does not remove the creature's agency; it makes agency possible. God moves all things toward the good as first cause, while secondary causes write the concrete story of history. When grace heals and elevates nature, the will becomes more free, not less, because it is set in order toward its true good. Guilt is real where the will rejects the good. Merit is real where grace and freedom cooperate in love.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Philosophical Lens</h2>
        <p>Think in terms of levels rather than rivalry. A sculptor causes a statue through form and final purpose. Hammer and chisel cause through contact and motion. Causes do not crowd one another when they operate at different orders. Likewise, God's action does not push alongside creaturely pushes. God's action enables created actions and orders them toward the good. Creatures truly cause within that gift.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Pastoral Counsel</h2>
        <p>Providence is not a puzzle to solve before one can obey. It is a promise that gives courage to act. When decisions are hard, seek counsel, weigh goods, pray for wisdom, and choose the better act of love. Trust that God can guide, correct, and redeem.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Practice</h2>
        <p>Take fifteen minutes. Name one decision before you. Ask three questions: what good is at stake, who is affected, and what act best loves the persons involved. Choose one step today and review it tomorrow with honest gratitude and sorrow.</p>
