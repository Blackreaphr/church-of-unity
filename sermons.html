      <section class="section dropcap" id="sample-beatitudes">
        <h2>Sample Sermon: Beatitudes</h2>
        <h3>Blessed Are the Poor in Spirit</h3>
        <p><strong>Text:</strong> Matthew 5:1-12, focus on verse 3. &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo; (KJV).</p>
        <p>The Sermon on the Mount begins with a surprise. Jesus names a kind of poverty as blessed. This is not a romance with misery. It is the honest recognition that our life is received. We do not generate our own light. We live from God.</p>
        <p>Poverty of spirit is the door. The proud heart stays outside because it believes it lacks nothing. The poor in spirit can enter because empty hands are free to receive. The blessing is not a prize for successful weakness. It is a gift attached to a truth about reality. God is the giver. The kingdom belongs to those who know they need him.</p>
        <p>Think of a house with many rooms. Each room is an aspect of life: work, family, memory, desire, fear. We can try to lock these rooms from the inside. We can also open the doors. Poverty of spirit turns the key. It says, &ldquo;Lord, this too is yours.&rdquo; The point is not self-contempt. It is trust. The self is safest when entrusted to God.</p>
        <p>Many Christians speak of providence. God sustains all things and works through ordinary causes. Poverty of spirit aligns with providence. It loosens the grip of anxious control and makes us ready to cooperate with grace. Freedom grows here, not smaller but truer, because it is no longer driven by the need to prove, compare, or win.</p>
        <p>What does this look like in practice? A student who asks for help before panic turns a task into a crisis. A parent who names fatigue and receives care rather than hiding behind a bright face. A leader who admits limits and invites others to share the work. Each act is small. Each act opens a window. Air moves. Light enters. The kingdom is near.</p>
        <p>The Beatitudes form a sequence. Poverty of spirit clears space. Mourning teaches honest sorrow before God. Meekness is strength bridled by love. Hunger and thirst for righteousness orient desire toward the good. Mercy bends power to heal. Purity of heart trains attention toward God. Peacemaking joins truth and courage. Steadfastness in persecution keeps hope when faith costs. The first step remains the same: open the hands.</p>
        <p>Some hear &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; and fear loss. The Gospel makes a different promise. When we surrender the illusion of self-sufficiency, we do not shrink. We are given back to ourselves in friendship with God. The kingdom is not a distant reward. It is God's reign taking root in the present, bearing fruit in patience, justice, and joy.</p>
        <p>Let one line travel with you today: &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit.&rdquo; When you meet a task that stirs anxiety, breathe and say, &ldquo;I receive this moment from you.&rdquo; When you meet a joy, say, &ldquo;I receive.&rdquo; When you meet a limit, say, &ldquo;I receive.&rdquo; These simple prayers are not magic. They are a steady practice of truth. God is God. We are his. The kingdom belongs to those who know it.</p>

        <h2>Reflection Questions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Where do I most try to live without help from God or others?</li>
          <li>Which room in my life needs its door opened to grace this week?</li>
          <li>What would poverty of spirit change about how I work, rest, or speak?</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="section" id="practice">
        <h2>Practice</h2>
        <p>A pocket examen for humility. At midday and at night, ask three questions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What did I receive today?</li>
          <li>Where did I cling or grasp?</li>
          <li>What can I place back into God's hands?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Close with the prayer, &ldquo;Lord, teach me poverty of spirit.&rdquo;</p>
